License

The CLucene code is split into two sections for licensing reasons. The 'Core'
is strictly dual licensed Apache 2 and LGPL. The CLucene Contributions code
could not be licensed under Apache because of the subcomponents it uses.

CLUCENE CORE:

The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. 
These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute
their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*
licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your
needs.

For details of these licenses see APACHE.license and LGPL.license in the root
of the source distribution.

Some components of CLucene Core use other licenses. See the CLUCENE CORE SUBCOMPONENTS
section for details. We understand that these licenses are compatible with LGPL and/or
Apache v2, but please consult with a lawyer to be certain of this.

To rephrase the licensing and to make it perfectly clear:
CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 
	*or*
the Apache License, Version 2.0

However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to participate fully 
in the free software community by contributing their code back to the project. 
Dual licensing of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the 
technology both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies 
that cannot use the GPL license.

You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different
ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license
used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or
added features.

Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for
more information.


CLUCENE CORE SUBCOMPONENTS: 

CLucene includes a number of subcomponents with separate copyright 
notices and license terms. Your use of the source code for the
